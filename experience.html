                    <p class='text-justify'>I was hired into this student position at Rutgers University in November of 2017.  In this position, I was assigned to a few different projects.  The first project I was given was the web moderation for a mobile app for a teacher's conference (more information in my <a href='projects.html'>projects</a> page.)  This was a project that needed to be coded in pure HTML and Javascript using Firebase as the database.</p>
                    <p class='text-justify'>Other projects I was assigned to were programmed in PHP using Laravel Frameworks and SQL.  These projects were developed in a virtual machine Ubuntu server environment.</p>
                    <p class='text-justify'>In addition to these new apps that I was assigned, I also helped maintain existing apps after a member of the department left the organization.  These legacy apps were programmed in JSP using Apache Tomcat for deployment and SQL for database access in a Ubuntu server virtual machine environment as well.</p>

                    <p class='text-justify'>This was a nine-week internship working in Ignition by Inductive Automation. The purpose of this internship was to design and maintain inventory and vendor screens for the company's internal system.  Ignition has a drag and drop interface, but Python was heavily used for scripts to program what happened when buttons were pressed or drop down menus were changed (similar to how Javascript is used on web pages). SQL was used for database connections.</p>

                    <p class='text-justify'>Separate from my role as Demand Planner at Benjamin Moore (more on that below), I also completed an internship in my sophomore year.  The sole purpose of this internship was to upgrade the company's Microsoft Access databases from 1993 version of MS Access to the 2007 version.</p>
                    <p>The databases that were being used before my intership wouldn't even open in 2007 MS Access, so I designed each database from scratch using SQL as necessary to reconstruct tables, queries and macros to produce identical outputs.</p>

                    <p class='text-justify'>I started in this role simply as a Demand Planner/Project Manager.  My daily duties included forecasting how many gallons of paint we would sell over a 12 month forecast horizon, and project managing all new product commercialization. </p>
                    <p class='text-justify'>After completing my internship (more on that above) with Benjamin Moore, I transitioned to more of an Access "DB Admin" for the department.  The company was transitioning into SAP and there were massive changes with the data, so the Access databases also had to change.  This became my full time position: redesigning all of the tables, queries and macros to conform with the new program (SAP) requirements.  Then when the system went live I continued troubleshooting issues that came up across all of the department databases.</p>
                    <p class='text-justify'>Although MS Access is widely considered to not be a 'real' database in terms of programming, these were very complex databases that had almost 500 tables and queries each.  Some queries nested down deeply into further queries as well, so troubleshooting the databases was something that only someone with a programmer's knowledge could accomplish.</p>

                    <p class='text-justify'>This role was a pure supply/demand planning role. I spent most of my time putting together a manual forecast (over a 12 month horizon) and planning production of USB drives.</p>

                    <p class='text-justify'>As Supply Chain Analyst I created, maintained, and distributed many spreadsheet forecasting tools used daily by the Supply Planners.  This was my first taste of what programming might be like. All of my spreadsheets included many functions, most of which were nested (like nested if-statements, counting the number of products that had a length of more than 10 characters, or parsing through part numbers looking for specific characters to determine which division it belonged to.)</p>
                    <p class='text-justify'>During my time in this role, the company upgraded their system to use Oralce MRP. This mostly affected the planning department, and because I was more 'tech-savvy' than anyone else in the department, I was thrown into the requirements meetings.  The IT department quickly made me the project manager for the project.  It was my job to make sure all of the tasks were being completed on time.  It was also my job to come up with all of the unit tests and do all of the preliminary review/testing of the program components before the rest of the department saw it.</p>
                    <p class='text-justify'>After Oracle MRP was successfully implemented, the IT department made me project manager on a few other smaller implementations which were also implemented successfully.  It was at the encouragement of the people I worked with in the IT department that I decided to go back to school for a degree in Computer Science.</p>
