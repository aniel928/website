      									<p>This was a project I worked on during my time as a Student Application Developer working at Rutgers University - ITaCS.</p>
      									<h6>Objective</h6>
      									<p>The main application of this department-wide project is a mobile app designed for a teacher conference. With a theme of "Collaborate," the mobile app is designed for attendees to take and post pictures with certain themes.  By posting pictures, they receive points and compete for prizes.  Additionally, as pictures are taken they are compiled into a mosaic on a TV screen in the main room of the conference.</p>
      									<p>In order to ensure that no inappropriate pictures or comments appear on the mosaic TV screen, there was a need for moderation of all pictures and comments. This was achieved with a website that first requires administrator login. After the admin logs in, they are brought to an “Admin Dashboard”. At that point the admin has options to moderate photos, moderate comments, add objectives, and add other administrators.</p>
      									<h6>Technologies</h6>
      									<p>The website is programmed using the following technologies:
      										<ul>
      											<li>Languages</li>
    											<ul>
      												<li>Javascript</li>
      												<li>HTML/CSS</li>
		      									</ul>
		      									<li>Database</li>
		      									<ul>
		      										<li>Firebase Realtime Database</li>
		      										<li>Firebase Javascript API</li>
		      									</ul>
		      								</ul>
											<h6>Functionalities</h6>
											<ul>
												<li>Log-In / Log-Out Functionality</li>
												<p>This was accomplished using Firebase Authentication</p>
												<li>Admin Dashboard</li>
												<p>The admin dashboard is just a navigation page that allows the admin to choose what they would like to do next.</p>
												<li>Photo Moderation</li>
												<p>On this page, one picture is pulled at a time from the database and is displayed on screen.  The comment and the objective description are also displayed on screen.  The admin has the choice to approve the photo or to reject it. (Rejections may occur when a photo/caption is inappropriate or if the picture doesn't match the objective displayed.)</p>
												<li>Comment Moderation</li>
												<p>On this page, a picture is displayed with all comments underneath.  If a comment is not yet approved, it will have approve/reject buttons.  If it is approved, it will show without buttons.  If it is rejected, it will not display.  Only pictures with at least one unmoderated comment will appear on this page. </p>
												<li>Add/View Objectives</li>
												<p>A list of all objectives including any camera overlays for the application camera.  There is the opportunity to add new objectives, as well as new categories of objectives.</p>
												<li>Add/View Admins</li>
												<p>A list of all current admins with options to add to and delete from the list.</p>

				    				<h5>Name</h5>
				    				<p class='font-weight-light pl-3'>Partial Operating System</p>
				    				<h5>Dates Worked On:</h5>
				    				<p class='font-weight-light pl-3'> October 2017 - December 2017 </p>
				    				<h5>Description</h5>
				      				<p class = 'font-weight-light pl-3'> As part of my Operating Systems class, we were assigned a semester long project to build components of an operating system.  This project was broken down into three segments:
				      					<ul>
				      						<li>Asst1: Scheduler and User Threads Library</li>
				      						<p> The objective here was to build a user thread/mutex library and multi-level priority queue with built in priority inversion.
				      						<ul>
				      							<li>Priorities and Quantums/TimeSlices:</li>
												<p>We implemented a multi-level priority queue with 4 levels total (0-3). All newly created threads start in level 0. Each level received 2^priority quantums (1, 2, 4, and 8 respectively). Every maintenance cycle we put 38 threads from level 0, 17 threads from level 1, 7 threads from level 2, and 2 threads from level 3 into the running queue.</p>
												<li>Promotion/Demotion</li>
												<p>After each thread finishes its quantum, it is demoted to the next queue (unless it is already in the lowest queue). If a thread yields, it does not demote. If a thread is placed onto a waiting queue (through a join or mutex lock), it is placed back into the same priority queue it was in prior to locking. If a thread has been on a given priority queue for more than 5 maintenance cycles, it is promoted up one level.</p>
												<li>Maintenance</li>
												<p>The maintenance cycle is used to increase priority levels of threads who have been in the cycle for too long. We determined that any thread that has been inactive for 5 cycles will have their priority level increased. Once it is increased it is relocated in the multi-level priority queue. After all threads have been placed into their appropriate location, the createRunning() method is called, which pulls a specified amount of threads from each priority level and adds them into a queue which will be used for execution.</p>
												<li>Handling​ ​Priority​ ​Inversion</li>
												<p>Priority inversion was handled using Priority Inheritance (PInh). With PInh, when there is a low priority thread locking a mutex and a higher priority thread enters, then the low priority thread “inherits” the higher one’s priority.  It then runs inside the higher priority queue (never being demoted to a lower queue) until it unlocks the mutex to allow the higher priority thread into the lock. This will prevent the high priority thread from waiting a large amount of time for the low priority thread to run and release the lock.
												<ul><li>Implementation</li>
												<p>Inside the mutex_lock function, when a thread (A) is passed to the waiting queue, the priority of A is compared to the priority of the mutex owner (B). If A’s priority is less than B’s then A will be added to the end of the waiting queue. However if A’s is greater than B’s then PInh is set in place. Thread A will be placed at the head of the waiting queue instead of the tail and B will be forced to run at level 0 (highest priority) without being demoted to a lower priority over time, until it is able to finish and release the mutex. At that point A is a able to gain control of the mutex and and can run normally.</p>
											</ul></p></li>
											</ul>
				      						<li>Asst2: Psuedo-Virtual Memory</li>
				      						<p>The objective was to take our previous project and build in virtual memory.  We were allowed to keep OS space and User space separate, but all malloc calls would redirect back to our user thread library and be handled through our own virtual memory structures.
				      						<ul>
				      							<li>MetaData Structure:</li>
				      							<p>For OS region and shared region:  A struct containing an int to check if used, an int to record size, and a pointer to the next metadata.</p>
				      							<p>For user region: A struct containing a boolean to check if used, an int to record size, an int to record number of pages, and a pointer to the next metadata.</p>
				      							<li>Page Tables: </li>
				      							<p>Internal: each thread has a page table associated with their TCB which holds the page index, the maxsize currently free in that page, an offset in the swap file that defaults to -1 when not being used, and a pointer to the next</p>
				      							<p>External: a 2-dimensional global array, each row holds data about a specific page, the first column holds which page owns it (defaults to -1, when freed set to -2 to guarantee segfault handler), second column holds how many malloc calls are currently using it (so it won't be deleted prematurely).</p>
				      							<li>Basic Logic/Design of user section:</li>
				      							<ul>
				      								<li>First our program checks to see how many pages the allocation needs.</li>
			      									<li>If it needs more than one page, it allocates fresh pages to the thread.</li>
				      								<li>If it needs less than one page, it first checks to see if there is room in an existing page.</li>
				      								<li>If there is, it squeezes it into an existing page.</li>
				      								<li>If there isn't, it creates a new one.</li>
				      								<li>Once the new space is allocated, we write to the internal page table and external page table</li>
				      								<li>if it was written to a page that already held something, we increment the counter in external as well so when it's time to free we know that more than one thing is using that page. </li>
				      							</ul>
				      						</ul>
				      						<li>Asst3: User Space File System (using FUSE)</li>
				      						<p>The assignment was to build separately from the other projects a user-space file system (using FUSE).  We had to replicate the following commands:
				      						<ul><li>touch filename</li><li> echo 'text' >> filename</li><li>cat filename</li><li>rm filename</li></ul></p>
				      						<p>We also built in directory functions (mkdir, rmdir, and being able to navigate around) for extra credit.</p> 
				      						<ul>
				      						<li>Metadata about the file:</li>
				      						<p>blocks[INODEBLOCKS + DATABLOCKS] is an array of chars (acting as block indices), partitioned into two regions. The first region references inodes and the second references data blocks.</p>
				      						<li>Extensions/Improvements:</li>
				      						<p>The Extension/Improvement we decided to implement was directory support. We also implemented the Extended Directory Operations for extra credit. </p>
				      						<li>Structs and Enums:</li>
				      						<p>Boolean Enum:<ul><li>FALSE (as 0)</li><li>TRUE (as 1)</li></ul></p>
				      						<p>Filetype Enum:<ul><li>FILE_NODE</li><li>DIR_NODE</li></ul></p>
				      						<p>Inode struct:<br>
				      							The inode struct is exactly 512 bytes (the size of one block) and contains:
				      							<ul>
				      								<li>An integer representing the size of the file it references</li>
				      								<li>An integer representing:
				      									<ul>
				      										<li>For Files: the number of data blocks a file is currently referencing</li>
				      										<li>For Directories: the number of files/directories inside of that directory.</li>
				      									</ul></li>
				      								<li>An integer array of all data blocks the file references (empty for directories)</li>
				      								<li>An integer representing links to the file<br>
				      								<ul><li>We did not implement links for files, but this is incremented for directories everytime a directory is made inside of it (because of the ‘..’ inside the new directory) and decremented everytime a directory is removed from within.</li></ul></li>
				      								<li>A filetype value which is used to distinguish if the inode is used for a file or a directory
				      									<ul><li>we declared an enum for this that can be found at the top of the file below the include header section. </li></ul>
				      								</li>
				      								<li>A mode_t value which is used to store the read, write, and execute capabilities of a file as well as S_IFDIR or S_IFREG which gives further information for files vs directories.</li>
				      								<li>A time_t value used for the time that the file was created</li>
				      								<li>A time_t value used for the time that the file was last modified</li>
				      								<li>A time_t value used for the time that the file was last accessed</li>
				      								<li>An integer representing userId of the owner of the file.</li>
				      								<li>An integer representing the groupId of the owner of the file.</li>
				      								<li>Char array of 50 characters used to store the path.</li>
				      							</ul>

				      				<h5>Description</h5>
				      				<p class = 'font-weight-light pl-3'> As part of my Systems Programming class we were required to build a program in C to manage files across a socket connection.  We were tasked with programming both the client and server sides of the project.  This project was assigned over a four week period to groups containing two students. My partner and I split the work into client/server portions, and I handled the server side.</p>
				      				<p class = 'font-weight-light pl-3'>The main way we accomplished this was to include functions to replace open(), read(), write(), and close() with netopen(), netread(), netwrite(), and netclose().  Everytime a file needed to be accessed or modified in any way, the client side would redirect the request (using macros) over the socket.</p>
				      				<p class = 'font-weight-light pl-3'>Part of this project also required coming up with a communication protocol.  The protocol we designed was communicating messages across the server in the format of [size of message],[2-digit-command][command specific info]. Here are a few examples:
				      					<ul><li>13,OP1./pathname => where 13 is the size of the message after the comma, OP means open, 1 is the flag (O_RDONLY), and ./pathname is the pathname to open.</li>
				      					<li>7,RD-6,10 => where 7 is the size of the message after the first comma, RD means read, -6 is the file descriptor, and 10 is the number of bytes to read in from that file.</li>
				      					<li>21,WR-6,well hello there => where 21 is the size of the message after the first comma, WR is the command to write, -6 is the file descriptor, and “well hello there” is what is to be written into that file.</li>
				      					<li>4,CL-6 => where 4 is the size of the message after the first comma, CL is the command to close, and -6 is the file descriptor.</li></ul></p>
				      				<p class = 'font-weight-light pl-3'>You'll notice above that all of the file descriptors were negative.  This was on purpose to ensure that if a user program on the client side tried to open the FD, it would not accidentally open the wrong file.  One the FD was passed back to the server side, the server took the inverse of the FD and retrieved the proper file.</p>
